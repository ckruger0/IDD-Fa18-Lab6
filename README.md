# ChatBot

*A lab report by Chris Kruger - crk78*

## In this Report

To submit your lab, fork [this repository](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/IDD-Fa18-Lab6). You'll need to upload any code you change into your fork, as well as upload a video of a friend or classmate using your chatbot.

## Make the ChatBot your own

I edited the ChatBot to be a KeyboardBot, that would make sure that all the number keys on your keyboard are working properly. This works by confirming that your inputs for each number key press correspond with the correct values. It covers digits 0-9 and congratulates the user on a great keyboard at the end if they all work.

## Record someone trying out your ChatBot

A half video of someone trying my ChatBot can be seen here: <a href="https://youtu.be/Gm0v1hiVQsE">https://youtu.be/Gm0v1hiVQsE</a><BR>
  
It is a half video because I originally shot it vertically and switched it over to horizontal.
